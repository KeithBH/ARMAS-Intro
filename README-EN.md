# Introduction to Automated Robot Management & Analysis System

The Automated Robot Management & Analysis System (ARMAS) is an automated analysis platform that implements closed-loop quality control for industrial robot programs in automotive BIW workshops.

## ü§î Background

Automotive OEM BIW workshops have thousands of industrial robots, and traditional manual management methods face problems such as cumbersome program acquisition and low inspection efficiency.

Core Pain Points
- Program deployment and maintenance rely on manual work, prone to errors and high costs;
- Lack of automated monitoring means, making it difficult to detect equipment abnormalities in time;

## üìã Mission

Core Objectives
- Achieve automation of the full lifecycle of robot programs (acquisition, inspection, modification), improving efficiency by over 50 times;
- Build a standardized program library to promote production line delivery quality improvement;
- Enable AI empowerment to lower usage barriers and achieve "zero manual inspection";
- Prevent equipment failures and reduce unplanned downtime losses.

## üíª Action

Automated Program Acquisition: Python reptile based on `Selenium`, supporting batch crawling of robot programs from multiple sites (including legacy equipment that cannot be integrated with FANUC ZDT);

Inspection Engine
- Use `difflib` library to implement program consistency comparison;
- Regular expression matching framework and parameter rules, supporting custom inspection;

Parameter Analysis: Extract key process parameters for spot welding, SPR, etc., completing workshop-level analysis in seconds;

System Architecture: Front-end and back-end separation (Python+Node.js+Vue), modular design supporting flexible expansion;

AI Deep Integration
- AICoding, 95% of code generated by AI (including backend, frontend, database);
- Support natural language to regular expression rules, lowering configuration barriers;

Automated Operations: Scheduled task scheduling, change notifications & visualization via Lark

## üí• Results

Efficiency Improvement
- Single robot program acquisition time reduced from 16.3 minutes to 15.7 seconds (62x efficiency improvement);
- Full inspection of 600+ robots in a single site reduced from 680 hours to 3 minutes;
- Spot welding parameter extraction completed in seconds, manual work of several days ‚Üí minute-level output.

Risk Prevention
- Early detection of 12 robots with abnormal spot welding trajectory parameters, avoiding equipment collisions;
- Identified 8 robots with missing cooling programs, preventing circuit burnout risks;

Standardized Management
- Established standard function block program library with difference positioning accurate to character level;
- Achieved real-time monitoring of program changes, improving push response speed by 90%;

Deliverables
- Software System: Complete functional platform (ARMAS) and deployment package;
- Intellectual Property: Invention patents and software copyright applications;
- Data Assets: Standard program library, parameter database, historical inspection reports;
- Technical Documentation: Complete process documentation for design, development, and operations.

## ‚òïÔ∏è Typical Application Scenarios

- Program Deployment Closed Loop: 100% standardized inspection of new production line programs, avoiding manual spot-check omissions;
- Predictive Maintenance: Predict equipment failures through parameter trend analysis;
- Rapid Troubleshooting: Historical program version comparison, minute-level anomaly location;
- Cross-site Collaboration: Support multi-site program difference adaptation and unified management.

This system was designed and developed during my tenure at Li Auto. Although most of the time spent on this project was concentrated during non-working hours, due to confidentiality, compliance, and professional ethics requirements, I cannot demonstrate code, design diagrams, etc.
